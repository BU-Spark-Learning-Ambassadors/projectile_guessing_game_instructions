# Projectile Guessing Game
# Micro-Challenge: Raging Rabbits Game

**Difficulty:** ⭐️

**What You Will Build:**
In this micro-challenge, you will create an interactive Python game called "Raging Rabbits." The game involves setting the initial launch velocity and angle for a cannon, launching projectiles, and calculating how close the projectile lands to the target. The challenge promotes learning about basic physics and user interaction.

**How You Will Build It:**
You will implement the game using Python. The game will involve user input, calculations, and conditional statements to determine the player's success in hitting the target.

**Duration:**
1-2 Hours

## Instructions

### Setup
1. Open a Text Editor: Users can choose a text editor to write their Python code. Common options include Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or any code-specific text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

2. Write the Python Code: Users can write the Raging Rabbits game code in the chosen text editor. They can copy and paste the code provided in the previous responses.

3. Save the File: Save the file with a .py extension, for example, raging_rabbits_game.py. This file extension is essential for Python files.

4. Run the Python Code:
   Open the command prompt or terminal on their computer.
   Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved. They can use the cd command to change directories.
   Execute the script by typing python raging_rabbits_game.py (or the name of their Python file) and press Enter.

### Challenge
Create the "Raging Rabbits" game with the following features:

1. Welcome the player to the game and ask for their initial launch velocity (in m/s).

2. Calculate and display the minimum and maximum distances the player can hit a target with launch angles between 10 and 45 degrees.

3. Generate a random target distance within the calculated range.

4. Prompt the player to enter their launch angle (in degrees).

5. Calculate and display the distance traveled by the projectile.

6. Calculate the error, which is how far the projectile landed from the target.

7. Check if the player hit the target (error within a specified range), and display an appropriate message.

8. Allow the player to play the game multiple times if desired.

**Game Rules:**
- The player wins if the projectile lands within a specified range of the target.
- The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to hit the target.

**Constraints:**
- Ensure that the code is clean, well-documented, and user-friendly.
- Use appropriate data types for input and calculations.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values.
- You may use the provided functions as a template, but make improvements for efficiency and clarity.

**Challenge Extension:**
- Add more features to the game, such as keeping track of the player's score or allowing multiple rounds.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Customize the game with your own creative ideas!

Have fun coding the Raging Rabbits game and exploring the world of physics and game development in Python!
