# Function to calculate the horizontal distance a projectile can travel
def calculate_projectile_distance(launch_angle, initial_velocity):
    # Convert the launch angle from degrees to radians
    # Calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile and return it
    # Use the projectile motion formula: d = (v^2 * sin(2 * theta)) / g
   

# Function to play the Raging Rabbits game
def raging_rabbits():
    # Display a welcome message to the player
    # Provide instructions for the game
    # Ask the player to input the initial launch velocity for the cannon
    # Store the input in a variable
    

    # Define the minimum and maximum launch angles for the target range
    # min_angle = 10 degrees, max_angle = 45 degrees
    
    # Calculate the minimum and maximum distances that the cannon can hit
    # Use the calculate_projectile_distance function with min_angle and max_angle
    
    # Display the range of distances the player can hit
    # Show the calculated minimum and maximum distances

    # Generate a random target distance within the range
    # Use the random library to choose a random integer between min_distance and max_distance

    # Display the randomly selected target distance
    # Show the chosen target distance

    # Allow the player to make up to 5 attempts to hit the target
    # Use a loop that iterates 5 times for each attempt

        # Display the current attempt number
        # Show the attempt number to the player

        # Ask the player to enter the launch angle in degrees
        # Store the input in a variable

        # Calculate the distance traveled by the projectile
        # Use the calculate_projectile_distance function with the entered launch angle

        # Display the calculated distance
        # Show the distance the projectile traveled

        # Calculate the error, which is the difference between the target distance and the actual distance
        # Calculate the absolute error (positive value) for comparison

        # Check if the player hit the target within a 5-meter range
        # If the absolute error is less than or equal to 5, the player hit the target

            # Display a success message if the player hit the target
            # Show a success message to the player

    # Display a message if the player was not able to hit the target in 5 attempts
    # Show a message to the player indicating they didn't hit the target

# Call the Raging Rabbits game function if the script is executed directly
